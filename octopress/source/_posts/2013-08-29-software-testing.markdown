Testing can be throught
black-box testing: tester is unaware of the internal structure of the code
white-box testing: tester has full knowledge of the internals
grey-box testing: internals relevant to testing are known

Static test: verify requirements, syntax and others that do not require running the code
Dynamic test: verify the results by running it

Functional: check if the code is running according to the requirements. It is performed using white-box techniques and testing GUI, controw flow, input domain, output, manipulation and database.
Non-Functional: check performance, compatibility, security, usability and others.
