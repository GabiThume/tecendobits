Tomorrow is the first day of my Gnome OPW internship! I am anxious and with butterflies in my stomach :)
So to warm up my brain, I am going to make a review about the project.

In Mozilla Corporation, there is a Crash Stats Project that is called <a href=https://wiki.mozilla.org/Socorro>Socorro</a>. It is an open source project, so other companies are also using, like B2G and Thunderbird. The production for Firefox is hosted at <a href=https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/products/Firefox>https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/products/Firefox</a>.

(Right now I was reading about crashing reports and my Firefox Nightly crashed. I reported the crash, so it is easy to tell why this project is useful and interesting :D)

<!-- more -->

Socorro is a set of components for collecting, processing, storing and displaying crash dumps generated by remote clients. In the client-side is used the <a href=http://code.google.com/p/google-breakpad/>Breakpad</a> set of libraries for crash reporting. And the other components are:

<strong>

 Collector: collects breakpad minidump crashes (over HTTP POST);

 Monitor: watch for incoming crashes, feed to processor;

 Processor: turn breakpad minidump crashes into stack traces and other info;

 Middleware: provide HTTP REST interface for JSON reports and real-time crash data;

 Web UI: django-based application for visualizing and reporting.

</strong>

The latest documentation is avaliable at <a href=http://socorro.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>http://socorro.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html</a> where is placed the <a href=http://socorro.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html>Installation Guide</a>.

If you are interested in development or need some help to use, the Socorro/Breakpad IRC channel is a great place to start: irc://irc.mozilla.org/breakpad. And the mailing list is also very welcome to share: https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/tools-socorro :)

## Test Gardener 

Inside Socorro, I am going to work at Test Gardener Project with my mentor <a href=https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/sdeckelmann/>Selena Deckelmann</a>. The details about what is going to be are aavaiable at <a href=https://wiki.mozilla.org/GNOME_Outreach_Summer2013> Mozilla - Gnome Outreach Summer 2013 </a> page: 

<strong>*"Write unit and integration tests for Socorro related to database, backend crash storage and middleware. Through this project, you will learn all about how a high performance data warehouse application works, which technologies were chosen for different types of storage, what the limitations are of our existing system and how a modern development group works with continuous integration and production deployments. If accepted to this project, you'd be working with the WebTools team, a group of developers distributed throughout the world."*</strong>

So I am very happy about it! I am aiming for learn more about how a big project like this works and mostly how to write useful tests!

And let the winter of code begin!!
