<strong>How did you hear about this program? </strong>    
By Gnome Women mailing list [0].

<strong>We advise all students applying for coding projects to apply for  Google Summer  of Code as well. Are you planning to apply for Google  Summer  of     Code (once its application period opens on April 22)? </strong>     
Unfortunatelly I can't apply to Google Summer of Code because I am not currently affiliated in an university as student. In this way, I am applying  just for OPW.

<strong>Please     describe your experience with the organization's product as a user     and   as a contributor (include the information about the  contribution    you  made to the project you are interested in here): </strong>     
I  am using Mozilla Firefox since I started using a computer. I was always  interested in how the development in a large FOSS project like Firefox  happens. So, after visiting Gnome OPW page I came to Mozilla OPW page  and became interested in the Mozilla Crash Stats project: Socorro. From the project ideas list I was interested in both Bug Wrangler and Test Gardner but I found a way to contribute to Test Gardener by coding, which I feel more confortable with. Socorro is written in Python, the language I  love and the main objective is to write  unit/integration tests related to database, backend crash storage and  middleware. Through this project, I believe I will learn a lot about data warehouses, unit testing, crash stats and how a big development group works together.

My first developer experience with Socorro was installing its server and testing the features. After this I asked for help in #opw and #breakpad at irc.mozilla.org and was guided by my prospective mentor, Selena Deckelmann, to fork Socorro and create my own fork [1]. Then I edited the Installation Documentation including instructions to Mac OS and it was my first contribution to Mozilla [2]! Since that I am documenting all my steps as an OPW prospective internship in my blog [3].

Actually  I am working in a new bug [4] which is helping me to understand how to  write unit tests (the main objective of this OPW proposal) for Socorro  and Socorro Crash Stats django app. While developing for that ticket I was introduced for the architecture of   Socorro and I continue to study its source code and documentation   to  understand how can I better help the project.

<strong>Please describe your experience with any other FOSS projects as a user and as a contributor:</strong>        
I am a GNU/Linux user since 2009. In this time I was majoring in Computer   Science, so I was using FOSS in all my courses. This helped  me  to   understand a lot about how softwares really work. I have  Python, Processing, JavaScript and Puredata as my prefered  programming languages. Using them I created some FOSS projects I consider relevant to  note here: a celullar automata sandbox made  using Processing.js [0]    and an interactive sorting algorithms guide  using Popcorn.js [1]. I   also  contributed to a live coding language  using Web Audio API [2]  and  a  live editor for creative coding in Web  [3]. Along software   development I  was always experimenting with open  hardware, mixing   wearables and  crafts with Arduino and circuits [4,5].

As contributor of a big FOSS project, I am starting now, and OPW is  being an incredible oportunity to me. Therefore, I had given a lot  of   workshops and I always tend to libert my code to everyone.

<strong>Please describe any relevant projects that you have worked on previously and what knowledge you gained from working on them:</strong>        
I researched Free Hardware and Software Socialization as part of a scholarship  extension program in Colmeia Group [1] (a University  LUG)   for one  year and a half (2009/2010). During this scholarship I contributed  for the development of a Linux distribution/mod for the    University  of Santa Catarina's [2] Central Library and given talks and workshops to newcomers in free software.

I am  also a member of MuSA [3] Collective (Multimedia, Systems and  Arts)    where I  developed experiments in open software and open  hardware,    mainly related with wearable computing using FLOSS  technologies like Processing,  Scratch, Puredata and Arduino. I did  some workshops and    presentations as MuSA member, to spread the work in  FOSS, open  hardware   and the mix of arts and free culture: "Atelier  Livre" (Free  Atelier)   [4], "Free Robotics Marathon in Latin America"  [5],  "Robotics Marathon   in CS Week" [6], "Phytonetiké Installation"  [7],  "I Free Atelier" [8],   "Creative Computation Workshop" [9] and  others  events listed in [3].

Actually I am also a member of LabMacambira.sf.net Collective [10], where I     current develop free software mainly for Web and audiovisual.

<strong>What project(s) are you interested in (these can be in the same or different organizations)?</strong>      
I am interested in Test Gardener Project from Mozilla. I am also interested in Bug Wrangler project from Mozilla and Media Type Reprocessing from MediaGoblin.

<strong>Who is a possible mentor for the project you are most interested in?</strong>     
The mentor in Mozilla Test Gardener is Selena Deckelmann (selenamarie@irc.mozilla.org).

<strong>Please  describe  the details and the timeline of the work you plan to accomplish on  the project you are most interested in (discuss these first with  the mentor of the project):</strong>         
My project to MediaGoblin is Test Gardener inside Socorro Project.  The main idea of the project is to write unit tests (and review  existing ones) for Socorro and Socorro Crash Stats django Web  application.

My planned schedule -- together with milestones and OPW announced events -- is the following:

*1 May - 27 May:* Discussing  with my mentor about the exact features and means of    implementation around Socorro unit tests. I want to stay in sync with my mentor ideas and study better the existing unit tests to understand how to implement new ones. I am planning to document, in Mozilla Socorro wiki, all the unit tests I  will be working with -- developing and reviewing -- and stay open for  unit tests already present in Bugzilla and others my mentor and WebTools  team at Mozilla could suggest. I will start  coding -- and probably fixing related tickets  and   creating new ones -- to cover those unit tests.
 
*Milestone I @ May 27:* accepted participants announced on Gnome page at 7pm UTC 
 
*27 May - June 17:* Implement  unit tests for Socorro, I imagine I will still with this task along the  entire summer, developing unit tests and discussing with Selena my  implementations. We will create those bugs in BugTrack and work from those together.

*Milestone II @ June 20:* be synced with mentor and have all details planned.
 
*June 17 - June 24:* Implement unit tests for Socorro and Socorro Crash Stats. Continue to review existing unit tests (and delete particular ones).
 
*June 25 -  July 2:*  Implement unit tests for Socorro and Socorro Crash Stats. Review  existing unit tests. Start investigating how to improve existing test  suite.
 
*July 3 - July 10:* Still work in implementation of unit tests. Possibly implement features to improve test suite.
 
*July 11 -  July 18:* Still work in implementation of unit tests.
 
*July 19 - July 30:*  Still work in implementation of unit tests.

*Milestone III @ July 30:* to participants in good standing with their mentors 

*July 31 - August 14:* Still work in implementation of unit tests.
 
*August 15 - August 29:* Still work in implementation of unit tests.
 
*August 30 - September 13:* Still work in implementation of unit tests. Start formatting all the source code and documentation to the final weeks.
 
*September 14 - September 23:* Still work in implementation of unit tests.  Being prepared for the the end of summer with everything (unit tests,  bugs, documentation) well done and ready to upload to review, if  necessary.
 
*September 23:* Final day!
  
*Milestone IV @ September 27:* to participants who have successfully completed their internships 

I  imagine the whole process as an incremental development, in this way, I  can't presume with details all the steps I'll follow, but I believe I  will in constant touch with my mentor to develop what is going to be  needed. This timeline could change a lot during the process and I am prepared for that. I am totally open for suggestions from my mentor and Mozilla community!

I am planning to document my steps in a daily basis in an Etherpad [0] and my personal blog [1].

<strong>Will you  have any other time commitments, such as school work, another    job,    planned vacation, etc., between June 17 and September 23?</strong>       
Absolutely not, I graduated last year and since that I am totally free of commitments. I can work fulltime and will be totally commited to the project if selected.
