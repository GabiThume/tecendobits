OMG! I am so much happy! I was <a href=https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/2013/JuneSeptember/#Mozilla>accepted</a> for Outreach Program for Women internship in Mozilla Crash Stats Project! 

This program is organized by the <a href=http://www.gnome.org/foundation/>GNOME Foundation</a>! What is awesome! :D   
And the feeling of being a Mozilla developer is so amazing!    
I am glad for everything!
