As a DIY enthusiast, <strong>Gabriela Salvador Thumé</strong> loves to
experiment with needles, seam, craft, circuits and algorithms.

She is in a master's program in Computing and Mathematical Sciences at ICMC/USP researching
Digital Image Processing. This project aims to contribute to the taxonomical
classification of green algae by applying image processing techniques while
pre-processing the optical microscopy images.

Recently (2013), she was in an internship for 3 months organized by <a
href=http://www.gnome.org/foundation/>GNOME Foundation</a> in a <a href=https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/products/Firefox>Mozilla Crash
Stats</a> project named <a href=https://wiki.mozilla.org/Socorro>Socorro</a>.

She had a <strong>Computer Science</strong> bachelor's degree at <a
href="http://www.joinville.udesc.br/">University of Santa Catarina State</a>
(2012). During her degree, she researched Affective Computing and Artificial
Intelligence under the orientation of prof. Rogério Eduardo da Silva in a work entitled <a
href=http://drama.musa.cc/downloads/TCC_Gabriela_Thume_2012-2.pdf>"Study and
implementation of a EBDI model for cognitive agents applied in virtual actors"</a>. 


She researched Free Hardware and Software Socialization as part of a scholarship
extension program in <a href="http://www.colmeia.udesc.br">Colmeia Group</a> for
one year and a half (2009/2010). During this scholarship contributed for the
development of a Linux distribution/mod for the University of Santa Catarina’s
Central Library and given talks and workshops to newcomers in free software.

In 2011 she developped and researched multimidia virtual actors in Guimarães, Portugal, attending in an internship on <a href = "http://www.ccg.pt/">Computer Graphics Centre (CCG)</a>.

Also a member of <a href = "http://www.musa.cc/">MuSA Collective</a>
(Multimedia, Systems and Arts) where developed experiments on software and
hardware, mainly related with wearable computing using FLOSS technologies like
<a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a>, <a href=http://scratch.mit.edu/>Scratch</a> and <a href="http://puredata.info">Pure Data</a>.
    
Currently also a member of <a href=http://wiki.nosdigitais.teia.org.br/Lab_Macambira>LabMacambira</a>
